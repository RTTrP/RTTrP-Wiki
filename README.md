Very simple, you do not need to edit *HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, ASP, JAVA, PERL, PYTHON, RUBY* and a billion other technologies. Just open .html file and edit TEXT in it. The marked text you are reading is written as plain text. Open the 'View page source' and see it. But if you want these are the technologies they are still.
